THE CURRENT CODE ISN'T UP-TO-DATE. NEW VERSION IS ABOUT TO GET UPLOADED SOON.

Project
- Android QR-code challenge response

- This first contribution is a login-application with
 a php-script which gets the user into the remote help
 session. The user needs to specify its own path to the
 php-script.

- I've also included my implementation of ZXing barcode
 scanner. And restricted it to only qr code. It's
 runnable on it's own and easy to implement into your
 own project.

- Currently this app communicates with a php-script to allow login. 
  And inside one are suppose to start up a challenge-response chain where
  a client user are in need of help.
  

1. To run this code you need to use your own php-script. I've written out where this should be done.
   It's where I create my httppost object.
