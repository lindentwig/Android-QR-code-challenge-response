Project
- Android QR-code challenge response

- This first contribution is a login-application with
 a php-script which gets the user into the remote help
 session. The user needs to specify its own path to the
 php-script.

- I've also included my implementation of ZXing barcode
 scanner. And restricted it to only qr code. It's
 runnable on it's own and easy to implement into your
 own project.
